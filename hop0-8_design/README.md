hop1_design-----------------> Done

This design has two flipflops, ff1 and ff2. ff1 has asynchronous reset while ff2 has synchronous reset. Both flipflop are mapped to different CLB

hop2_design------------------> in progress
this design has three flipflop. different IOs at left bottom and right top are tried for GEMINI with timing optimization as instructed by Sir Ashraf, but still 2 flip flop are mapped to same clb. (under review)
