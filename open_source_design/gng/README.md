# Gaussian Noise Generator (GNG) IP Core
==================================================


### Introduction
----------------------------------------
The Gaussian Noise Generator core generates white Gaussian noise of 
standard normal distribution, which can be used to measure BER to extremely 
low BER levels (~10-15). The core uses a 64-bit combined Tausworthe generator 
and an approximation of the inverse normal cumulative distribution function, 
which obtains a PDF that is Gaussian to up to 9.1¦Ò.
