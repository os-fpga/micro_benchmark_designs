# Introduction
This repository contains all the micro bechmark design needed for timing characterization. 
This includes 0-8 hop design, BRAM, and DSP benchmark design.

# Hop 0-8 Designs

 There are two directories (hop0-8_designs, hop0_8_designs_x_y) which contains the 0-8 hop design for L1 and L4 route
 The designs are organized into subdirectories and each subdirectory has a readme file with instructions on running the P&R flow.
 A timing summary file is created to list the L1 and L4 path being utalized with timing and CLB locations.
